I'm a brazilian biologist interested in biological rhythms and animal behavior, especially in social insects and their collective behavior. Currently, I'm a PhD student at Stanford University and I have the priviledge (and the luck) to be coadvised by two amazing women researchers: Deborah Gordon and Lauren O'Connell. I'm passionate about science communication and advocacy for diversity, equality and inclusion in science! I believe science and education are important tools to fight social inequality. I also have a podcast and blog in portuguese. You can find out more about my podcast Charlando [here](https://www.charlandopodcast.com/).

Besides being a passionate young scientist, I spend my free time playing the drums, dancing, trying to learn how to play the ukulele, and mostly: playing with my lovely cats and emotional support animals: Alfredo and Haroldo.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Hi, I'm Alfredinho!", out.width = '30%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Alfredinho.jpg")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Hi, I'm Haroldinho!", out.width = '30%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Haroldinho.jpg")
